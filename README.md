# HISTORY BEYOND MYTH

## Project Overview
- History Beyond Myth is a website that aims at providing the reader with curious coincidences between academically recognised history facts and some of the aspects of a well-known myth, such as the Arthurian cycle. The historical investigation exposed in this site has been going on for many years, and will continue to go on, updating whatever new coincidences are found on this matter.
- This site is useful for anyone who might be interested in history, more precisely from the European early Middle Ages, or also in myths and legends in general.
- The users of this site will be able to sign up in order to receive a monthly newsletter containing any new findings during the ongoing investigation, as well as interesting social and cultural events around Europe, related to myths and/or history from the early Middle Ages. Visits to sites related to the curious coincidences stated in the site will also be organized periodically.
- The users of this site who have already signed up will also be able to share any findings of their own related to the Matter of Britain, by sending the file of their choice through the form provided in the contact page.

# DESIGN CHOICES

## Colors
I have created the color palette myself, and the [Coolor.co](https://coolors.co/) website has only been used to display all the colors beautifully for the screenshot below. The colors selected are as follows:
- ***Turkey Red*** **#B30502** / **RGB(179,5,2)**:
    + **Use**: All headers' background color.
    + **Rationale**: The selection of this tone is due to two main factors.
        + The 1st point is that it is the background color of the [coat of arms](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blason_maison_Plantagen%C3%AAt.svg) of the [Plantagenet dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Plantagenet), which was the dynasty ruling England (1154-1485), and to which all the main characters of the website belonged.
        + The 2nd factor is that it is also the predominant color found in the illuminated manuscripts dated around the 13th century on which most of our investigation is founded, and more precisely the [roll genealogy of the Kings of England](https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=royal_ms_14_b_vi_f006r) dated c.1300 where our main characters' portraits are depicted. 
- ***Dark Red*** **#8F0303** / **RGB(143,3,3)**:
    + **Use**: Background color for the *footer*, and the *sign-up form*.
    + **Rationale**: A slighly darker tone than the former which ressembles bloodish red, reminding of the tragic and fatal ending of our main character, Arthur I of Brittany, who battled against John Lackland for the succession to the throne of England after King Richard "the Lionheart" died, and supposedly captured and murdered when he was only 16 years old by his opponent, who finally ruled.
- ***White Smoke*** **#F5F5F5** / **RGB(245,245,245)**:
    + **Use**: Fonts that are on an *Eerie Black* background.
    + **Rationale**: To ensure clear contrast and readability for the user. Also, its name *White Smoke* is the signal from the Vatican when a new Pope is selected. The church was all-mighty, and its power had no boundaries back in the Middle ages, so it also brings that to mind.
- ***Eerie Black*** **#1B1B1B** / **RGB(27,27,27)**:
    + **Use**: Backgrounds of content pages as *Arthur* and *Avalon*.
    + **Rationale**: To favour contrast with the colorful captions embeded, taken from medieval illuminated manuscripts on which the investigation is based. The ink used in those early medieval manuscripts, mostly made from insects and ashes, has also inspired this selection.
- ***Onyx*** **#424242** / **RGB(66,66,66)**:
    + **Use**: Fonts that have a background of *White Smoke*, in the *home page description section*, and the *sign-up page sections*.
    + **Rationale**: To gain clear contrast, and ensure users' readability, with a softer tone of dark grey.
- ***Jet*** **#2E2E2E** / **RBG(46,46,46)**:
    + **Use**: The navigation bar background color.
    + **Rationale**: It reminds of the shadows and obscurity that still cover the early Middle Ages' history and myths, still full of shadows to unveil. Also, the contrast with the *Turkey Red* from the headers reminds of the main plot sorrounding this site investigation, full of shadows and blood.
- ***Timberwolf*** **#D6D6D6** / **RGB(214,214,214)**:
    + **Use**: The *headers' 1st letters*, the *vertical or horizontal lines in the headers* that ressemble a spear or sword, and for the background of the *button to the sign-up page* in the navigation bar.
    + **Rationale**: Gives a metal-like appearance. All element have a strong shadow to give it volume. Middle Ages were full of iron: armours, shields, spears, swords, etc. But also cups, and all king of everyday medieval ustensils were made of metal.

## Typography  
- I found in [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) styles that match the Medieval topic of the website.
- The headings decrease in size to ensure full responsiveness of the website.
- Check the selection of Google Fonts [here](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fleur+De+Leah&family=Jim+Nightshade&family=Metamorphous&family=Montserrat:wght@400;500;600;700&family=Reenie+Beanie&family=UnifrakturCook:wght@700&display=swap))
 
### Fonts Used 
1. [UnifrakturMaguntia](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/UnifrakturMaguntia?query=unifrak): Medieval font by excellence, only used lower-case which are very readable, for index header's 1st letters, and for logo. Fall-back font to cursive.
2. [UnifrakturCook](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/UnifrakturCook?query=unifrak): Very similar to the previous, but upper-case are more readable, even if only available in bold. Used only for other pages than index's header, and only for the 1st letters. Fall-back font to cursive.
3. [Metamorphous](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Metamorphous?query=metamor): Medieval font, very readable upper & lower cases. Fall-back font to cursive.    
4. [Jim Nightshade](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jim+Nightshade?query=jim+night): Very readable old script, that fits the topic of the website. Fall-back font to cursive.  
5. [Reenie Beanie](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Reenie+Beanie?query=reeni): Only used in home page header for the word *"beyond"*. Being a modern script font, it brings an interesting contrast with the medieval fonts used in the rest of the header. It symbolyses modern investigation that seeks to go ***beyond*** the myth.  Fall-back font to cursive.  
6. [Fleur De Leah](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fleur+De+Leah?query=fleur): Stylish Flowery design. Exactly the same design used in medieval manuscripts included in website, upon which the investigation lays. Fall-back font to cursive.  
7. [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montse): Modern sans-serif very readable font for main content.   

### Rationale of Use
 - **LOGO**: Use of **UnifrakturMaguntia** for the single *h* from *"history"*. The logo is situated to the left of the navigation bar, and as a favicon in each page meta title:   

  <img width="100" alt="logo" src="https://github.com/Ethra8/History_Beyond_Myth/blob/media/android-chrome-192x192.png">

 - **HEADER (HOME PAGE)**:
      * Use of **UnifrakturMaguntia** (lower case) only for the *1st letters of main words* of main heading of each page.
      * The remaining text in headings use **Metamorphous** (upper case).
      * All headers' extra text (p) use **Jim Nightshade**.
      * **Reenie Beanie** is only used for the word *"beyond"* in the main page header, seeking a clear contrast between history, medieval mythos, and modern contemporary studies which precisely seek to go beyond the myth, trying to bring a modern and fresh approach to it.

 - **SECTION HEADINGS** (h2):
      * Only the 1st letter uses **Fleur De Leah**, which recreates the 1st letters of paragraphs from medieval manuscripts.
      * The remaining text uses **Jim Nightshade**, to ensure readability, but keeping the medieval spirit alive.
 
 - **MAIN CONTENT**
      * **Montserrat** is used for all paragraphs' content to ensure optimal readability of the site.

* [**HOME PAGE**](https://englishgrows.com/history_beyond_myth/index.html): Acting as the *landing page*, it contains the *Site description*, formed of *3 sections*:
    + *About us* - Site dedicated to state curious coincidences found during years of investigations
    + *Keeping it Real* - Highlights the fact that the site administrators in no case expose these findings as an ultimate truth behind the myth, but only as they are, just some curious coincidences.
    + *Reasons to Sign Up* - Numbers 4 different reasons a user might find interesting to sign up. This section includes a button-like anchor tag that links to the sign-up page.

* [**ARTHUR I**](https://englishgrows.com/history_beyond_myth/arthur_I.html): States the curious coincidences found between the legendary King Arthur, and the nephew of the childless King Richard "the Lionheart", who had formally named Count Arthur I of Brittany his heir, when this latter was only 3 years old. Count Arthur also had a tragic and fatal ending when he fought against the man who was to become *King John 'Lackland'* after he captured and supposedly murdered Arthur when he was 16 years old, and supported by most of the French territories who had been ruled by Richard.

* [**AVALON**](https://englishgrows.com/history_beyond_myth/avalon.html): States the curious coincidences found between the legendary Island of Avalon, and the Island of Guernsey, which was highly valued for having the best *European Abalones*, and for its strategic location. Could the *Island of Avalon* be a derivation from *Isle of Abalones*, considering the French pronuntiation of the word?

* [**SIGN-UP**](https://englishgrows.com/history_beyond_myth/sign_up.html): Gives details on the different reasons to sign-up, and includes a *Sign-up Form*.

## Design Elements

* **AUDIO**  
  + ***Avalon Page***: Audio tag with controls with the French Pronunciation of the word *abalone*, taken from the French [Laurousse Dictionary](https://voix.larousse.fr/francais/322395fra2.mp3)

* **VIDEO**  
  + ***Avalon Page***: there are 2 Youtube videos embeded. One is the song that King Richard "The Lionheart" wrote in old French, demonstrating that French was the prodominant language at that time, linking to the supposition that *abalone* might be the origin of *avalon* (Was Guernsey nicknamed the *Isle of Abalones*?) 

* **ICONS**  
  + ***Footer***: Fixed at the bottom of each page, it contains 4 icons. 3 are from social media (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook), and the 4th is an *envelope* icon from which the user can seamlessly send an email to the administrators of the site.   

* **INTERACTIVE MAP**
  + ***Avalon***: Included in the *Strategic Location* section, there is an interactive **Google Maps** map embeded showing the exact location of the Isle of Guernsey.

* **FORM**
  + ***Sign Up***: The form in the sing-up page includes the following ***inputs***:
    - *2 Inputs type=text required* - The user must include First name, and Last Name to be able to send the form.
    - *Input type=email required* - The user must include an email to be able to send the form.
    - *Input type=radio required* - The user must select 1 of 3 options, on whether he/she likes sight seeing. This field is requested, to help the site administrators decide on the frequency to organize seight seeing visits to emblematic places related to the investigation.
    - *Input type=file optional* - The user can include a file from his/her device, and send it together with the form. This option is meant for the user that has found a new curious coincidence and wants to share it.
    - *Textarea optional* - The user can include a message, if he/she wants to share some thoughts.
