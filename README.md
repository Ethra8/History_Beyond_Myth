## Project Overview

![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/history_beyond_myth/assets/80659091/1039498c-4536-46c8-b5c9-de5ebde786ca)


- History Beyond Myth is a website that aims at providing the reader with curious coincidences between academically recognised historical facts and some of the aspects of a well-known myth, such as the Arthurian cycle. The historical investigation exposed in this site has been going on for many years, and will continue to go on, updating whatever new coincidences are found on this matter.

- This site is useful for anyone who might be interested in history, more precisely from the European early Middle Ages, or also in myths and legends in general.

- The users of this site will be able to sign up in order to receive a monthly newsletter containing any new findings during the ongoing investigation, as well as interesting social and cultural events around Europe, related to myths and/or history from the early Middle Ages. Visits to sites related to the curious coincidences stated in the site will also be organized periodically.

- The users of this site who have already signed up will also be able to share any findings of their own related to the Matter of Britain, by sending the file of their choice through the form provided in the contact page.


**NOTE**: *Responsive images of the site automatically generated through [ui.dev/amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive). The tool is interactive, and you can view and scroll through all pages in all the types of devices simultaneously [here](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://englishgrows.com/history_beyond_myth/index.html). I customized defect background-color attribute from amiresponsive site from black to whitesmoke, as my website is mostly in dark tones. I did it by changing the elements of the page, more precisely **class="bg-brand-coal"**.*

# DESIGN CHOICES

## COLORS
I have created the color palette myself, and the [Coolor.co](https://coolors.co/) website has only been used to display all the colors beautifully for the screenshot below. The colors selected are as follows:

- ***Turkey Red*** **#B30502** / **RGB(179,5,2)**:

    + **Use**: All headers' background color.

    + **Rationale**: The selection of this tone is due to two main factors.

        1. It is the background color of the [coat of arms](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blason_maison_Plantagen%C3%AAt.svg) of the [Plantagenet dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Plantagenet), which was the dynasty ruling England (1154-1485), and to which all the main characters of the website belonged.

        2. It is also the predominant color found in the illuminated manuscripts dated around the 13th century on which most of our investigation is founded, and more precisely the [roll genealogy of the Kings of England](https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=royal_ms_14_b_vi_f006r) dated c.1300 where our main characters' portraits are depicted.

- ***Dark Red*** **#8F0303** / **RGB(143,3,3)**:

    + **Use**: Background color for the *footer*, and the *sign-up form*.

    + **Rationale**: A slightly darker tone than the former which resembles bloodish red, reminding of the tragic and fatal ending of our main character, Arthur I of Brittany, who battled against John Lackland for the succession to the throne of England after King Richard "the Lionheart" died, and supposedly captured and murdered when he was only 16 years old by his opponent, who finally ruled.

- ***White Smoke*** **#F5F5F5** / **RGB(245,245,245)**:

    + **Use**: Fonts that are on an *Eerie Black* background.

    + **Rationale**: To ensure clear contrast and readability for the user. Also, its name *White Smoke* is the signal from the Vatican when a new Pope is selected. The church was all-mighty, and its power had no boundaries back in the Middle ages, so it also brings that to mind.

- ***Eerie Black*** **#1B1B1B** / **RGB(27,27,27)**:

    + **Use**: Backgrounds of content pages as *Arthur* and *Avalon*.

    + **Rationale**: To favour contrast with the colorful captions embedded, taken from medieval illuminated manuscripts on which the investigation is based. The ink used in those early medieval manuscripts, mostly made from insects and ashes, has also inspired this selection.

- ***Onyx*** **#424242** / **RGB(66,66,66)**:

    + **Use**: Fonts that have a background of *White Smoke*, in the *home page description section*, and the *sign-up page sections*.

    + **Rationale**: To gain clear contrast, and ensure users' readability, with a softer tone of dark grey.

- ***Jet*** **#2E2E2E** / **RBG(46,46,46)**:

    + **Use**: The navigation bar background color.

    + **Rationale**: It reminds of the shadows and obscurity that still cover the early Middle Ages' history and myths, still full of shadows to unveil. Also, the contrast with the *Turkey Red* from the headers reminds of the main plot surrounding this site investigation, full of shadows and blood.

- ***Timberwolf*** **#D6D6D6** / **RGB(214,214,214)**:

    + **Use**: The *headers' 1st letters*, the *vertical or horizontal lines in the headers* that resemble a spear or sword, and for the background of the *button to the sign-up page* in the navigation bar.

    + **Rationale**: Gives a metal-like appearance. All element have a strong shadow to give it volume. Middle Ages were full of iron: armours, shields, spears, swords, etc. But also cups, and all king of everyday medieval utensils were made of metal.

## TYPOGRAPHY  
- I found in [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) styles that match the Medieval topic of the website.
- The headings decrease in size to ensure full responsiveness of the website.
- Check the selection of Google Fonts [here](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fleur+De+Leah&family=Jim+Nightshade&family=Metamorphous&family=Montserrat:wght@400;500;600;700&family=Reenie+Beanie&family=UnifrakturCook:wght@700&display=swap))
 
### FONTS USED 

1. [UnifrakturMaguntia](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/UnifrakturMaguntia?query=unifrak): Medieval font by excellence, only used lower-case which are very readable, for index header's 1st letters, and for logo. Fall-back font to cursive.

2. [UnifrakturCook](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/UnifrakturCook?query=unifrak): Very similar to the previous, but upper-case are more readable, even if only available in bold. Used only for other pages than index's header, and only for the 1st letters. Fall-back font to cursive.

3. [Metamorphous](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Metamorphous?query=metamor): Medieval font, very readable upper & lower cases. Fall-back font to cursive.    

4. [Jim Nightshade](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jim+Nightshade?query=jim+night): Very readable old script, that fits the topic of the website. Fall-back font to cursive.  

5. [Reenie Beanie](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Reenie+Beanie?query=reeni): Only used in home page header for the word *"beyond"*. Being a modern script font, it brings an interesting contrast with the medieval fonts used in the rest of the header. It symbolyses modern investigation that seeks to go ***beyond*** the myth.  Fall-back font to cursive.  

6. [Fleur De Leah](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fleur+De+Leah?query=fleur): Stylish Flowery design. Exactly the same design used in medieval manuscripts included in website, upon which the investigation lays. Fall-back font to cursive.  

7. [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montse): Modern sans-serif very readable font for main content.   

### RATIONALE OF USE

- **LOGO**: Use of **UnifrakturMaguntia** for the single *h* from *"history"*. The logo is situated to the left of the navigation bar, and as a favicon in each page meta title:   

  <img width="100" alt="logo" src="https://github.com/Ethra8/History_Beyond_Myth/blob/media/android-chrome-192x192.png">

- **HEADER (HOME PAGE)**:
    * Use of **UnifrakturMaguntia** (lower case) only for the *1st letters of main words* of main heading of each page.
    * The remaining text in headings use **Metamorphous** (upper case).
    * All headers' extra text (p) use **Jim Nightshade**.
    * **Reenie Beanie** is only used for the word *"beyond"* in the main page header, seeking a clear contrast between history, medieval mythos, and modern contemporary studies which precisely seek to go beyond the myth, trying to bring a modern and fresh approach to it.

- **HEADERS (CONTENT PAGES)**:
      * Use of **UnifrakturCook** (lower case) only for the *1st letters of main words* of main heading of each page.
      * The remaining text in headings use **Metamorphous** (upper case).
      * All headers' extra text (p) use **Jim Nightshade**.

- **NAVIGATION BAR**:

  *Use of **Metamorphous** in capital letters, which gives a very readable medieval style to the site.

    ![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/history_beyond_myth/assets/80659091/bd336a72-a4d7-471c-b3bd-60cfa170a935)


- **SECTION HEADINGS** (h2):
     
  * Only the 1st letter uses **Fleur De Leah**, which recreates the 1st letters of paragraphs from medieval manuscripts.

  * The remaining text uses **Jim Nightshade**, to ensure readability, but keeping the medieval spirit alive.

   ![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/history_beyond_myth/assets/80659091/b1a3c51c-d07d-4674-b24c-aebb9554cb29)

- **MAIN CONTENT**

## IMAGERY
Find below all the images used in this site, with a description and a link to their original source. The images have been listed by pages, and different devices' screen-size. Aiming at an effective responsiveness, sometimes different images show depending on the size of the device, as follows:

### HERO IMAGE
The hero image is the biggest image positioned below the header of the landing page (home page) appearing in tablets and laptops, and appears as well fixed at the background of the landing page in all devices. The image takes full sense in section 3 of Arthur I' page, where it also displays in all devices regardless of the screen size. It has been selected because it shows [Arthur I of Brittany with a crown giving homage to the King of France Philip Augustus](https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=royal_ms_16_g_vi_f361v) in return for this latter's support to his claim to the throne of England after King Richard the Lionheart's death. The source is the manuscript *"Les Grandes Chroniques de France"* [Royal MS 16 G VI](https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=royal_ms_16_g_vi), Royal MS 16 G VI, f.361v, dated 1332-1350, British Library.  

  ![image](https://englishgrows.com/history_beyond_myth/assets/images/arthur_crown_and_king_philip_les_grandes_chroniques_de_france_royal_ms_16_g_vi_f361v.jpg)

### HOME PAGE - IMAGERY
All the following images display in screens of all sizes:  

#### HOME PAGE - BACKGROUND IMAGE
Full caption of the whole page [f.361v](https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=royal_ms_16_g_vi_f361v) of the manuscript [Les Grandes Chroniques de France](https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=royal_ms_16_g_vi) from where the hero image aforementioned has been taken. Source is manuscript Royal MS 16 G VI, f.361v, British Library. When the user scrolls down from the header, the hero image  taken from this membrane of the manuscript appears fixed on the background, with some medieval text from the manuscript page also visible. As the image is meant to be used an a background in this case, a black shadowy transparency has been put over it, so it doesn't distract the user of the page's content.
    ![image](https://englishgrows.com/history_beyond_myth/assets/images/index_site_description_bg_img_les_grandes_chroniques_de_france_royal_ms_16_g_vi_f361v_full.avif)

#### HOME PAGE - UNDERNEATH THE HEADER
This section has a height of 200px in all screen sizes.  
All images in this section are related to the Arthurian mythos, and taken from digitalised medieval manuscripts written around the same century. Most images in this section reappear in subsequent pages. The images are here meant to be purely decorative, and their overflow is hidden, so users will see a different amount of images at this point, deppending on the size of the device used:

1. Depiction from author Matthew Paris of the [coat of arms of the House of Plantagenet](https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=royal_ms_14_c_vii_f085v), also called of Anjou, which was England's ruling dynasty at the time, and to which Richard I and Arthur I of Brittany belonged. Source is Manuscript Royal MS 14 C VII, dated 1250-1259, British Library.

2. Early medieval [map of Britain](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/matthew-paris-map-of-britain) dated 1250, from author Matthew Paris, from his work *Historiae Anglorum*. Original source is manuscript *Cotton MS Claudius D VI*, kept in the National British Library, but as it is stated in the original Cotton MS Claudius D VI manuscript [description](https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=cotton_ms_claudius_d_vi), the map was removed in year 1929, and now kept separately.

3. [Portrait of Count Arthur I of Brittany](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Artur_of_Brittany.jpg) first found in [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), heir to Richard I "the Lionheart" by birth right. Its original source is the [6th membrane](https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=royal_ms_14_b_vi_f006r) of the roll chronicle of Britain Genealogy dated 1300-1340, kept in the National British Library, as manuscript [Royal MS 14 B VI](https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=royal_ms_14_b_vi)

4. [Depiction of Arthur I in his castle, wearing a crown after Richard I's death, receiving Philip II of France](https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=royal_ms_16_g_vi_f361v) who is visiting him. Arthur is giving homage to Philip in return for his support to his claim to the throne of England. This depiction's original source and description is page f.361v of the illuminated manuscript dated 1332-1350, kept in the National British Library, called "Les Grandes Chroniques de France" [Royal MS 16 G VI](https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=royal_ms_16_g_vi).

  2. **ROW OF IMAGES**: Placed Underneath the header, all taken from medieval manuscripts, and related to the site's investigation and theories on the Arthur mythos.
  3. **SITE SDESCRIPTION**: Contains *3 sections*:
      1. **ABOUT US** - Site dedicated to state curious coincidences between academically recognised historical facts, and the Arthurian cycle, found during years of investigations.

      2. **KEEPING IT REAL** - Highlights the fact that the site administrators in no case expose these findings as an ultimate truth behind the myth, but only as they are, just some curious coincidences.

      3. **REASONS TO SIGN UP** - Numbers 4 different reasons a user might find interesting to sign up. This section includes a button-like anchor tag on the bottom that links to the *sign-up page*. The 4 reasons given relate to the target audience, the user profiles and profiles, and are the following:
          1. Receive a *monthly newsletter*.
          2. Become part of our vibrant community, and attend *cultural and social events* around Europe, such as expositions, lectures, and conferences.
          3. *Share users' new findings* with the site administration.
          4. Attend *organized visits* to emblematic sights related to the curious coincidences found between history and myth.

### [ARTHUR I PAGE](https://englishgrows.com/history_beyond_myth/arthur_I.html) - STRUCTURE
States the curious coincidences found between the legendary King Arthur, and the nephew of the childless King Richard "the Lionheart", who had formally named Count Arthur I of Brittany his heir, when this latter was only 3 years old. Count Arthur also had a tragic and fatal ending when he fought against the man who was to become *King John 'Lackland'* after he captured and supposedly murdered Arthur when he was 16 years old, and was supported by most of the continental territories who had been ruled by Richard. These facts are ordered in the following sections, each containing a caption on the bottom of the section, from medieval manuscripts related to the investigation which are all referenced through tiptools that display on hover:

1. **Heir to King Richard the Lionheart**

2. **Retained by the King of France**

3. **Death of King Richard I**

4. **Two Kings, One Throne**

### [AVALON PAGE](https://englishgrows.com/history_beyond_myth/avalon.html) - STRUCTURE
States the curious coincidences found between the legendary Island of Avalon, and the Island of Guernsey, which was highly valued for having the best *European Abalones*, and for its strategic location. Could the *Island of Avalon* be a derivation from *Isle of Abalones*, considering the French pronunciation of the word?. This page is divided into sections, each containing a picture, a video, or an interactive map on the left, and some related text on the right. The sections are responsive, and change their layout on smaller devices as tablets or phones, where the text goes on the top, and the image, map or video related, on the bottom of each section. The sections are the following:

1. **French Pronunciation of Abalone**: Contains an audio tag with controls of the word [*abalone* in French](https://voix.larousse.fr/francais/322395fra2.mp3). The source of this audio file is the French Larousse dictionary.

2. **England's Kings were French**: Contains a *Youtube* video with a song written by King Richard himself in old French dialect "[Ja nus Hos Pris](https://youtu.be/-1BG1UEACHs)", to provide the user with an entertaining way to acknowledge that in fact, England's kings spoke French on a regular basis, and not English.

3. **The Value of Abalones**: As some users may not be aware of the existence of these marine gastropod moluscs, this section provides references on the value of abalones from ancient times, both for their mother-of-pearl large-sized shell, with distinctive shades of color, as for their meat-like taste. Also brings references on how the Isle of Guernsey is home the most appreciated European abalone since ancient times.

4. **Medieval Jewelry**: This section provides the reader with evidence and reference of medieval jewelry from the Frankrish Kingdom made of mother-of-pearl (most probably abalone). There is also a picture of a [Frankrish gold brooch](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/465810) found dated c.600, part of the *Medieval Art* collection of the **The Met Museum** in New York.

5. **Abalones, the Sea Truffles**: This section aims to provide the reader with more detailed evidence and reference of what was previously stated in the section "the Value of Abalones". As abalones are still very much valued as a luxury product nowadays, considered the sea truffles by the French, a *Youtube* video has been included showing [two Michellin starred chef preparing and cooking abalones](https://youtu.be/o5VPONMX19Q) in his restaurant.

6. **Strategic Location**: This section has an interactive map from *Google Maps* showing the exact location of the Island of Guernsey, half-way from Brittany and south Wales.

7. **Mists of Guernsey**: This last section finally includes a seascape picture of Guernsey during sunset, clearly showing its mists surrounding the sharp rocks that go way in the ocean's shallow seabed all around the island. Some imagery of the mythical Island of Avalon depictures the island immersed into profound mists.

### [SIGN-UP PAGE](https://englishgrows.com/history_beyond_myth/sign_up.html) - STRUCTURE
This page contains the following:

- **Sign-up Form**: Placed on the top of the page in any screen size, after the header. On laptops, it is displayed on the right side of the screen, sharind the screen width with the events section. But as this page, as all others, is **responsive**, on smaller devices as tablets or phones, the form stays at the top, not sharing the width with the events section.

- **Events Section**: PLaced on the top-left side of large devices such as laptops, and after the form in smaller devices such as tablets or phones. This section contains two subsections:
    * **Social Events**: Brief description of the events that the user will be informed of, after deciding to sign-up.
    * **Sight Seeing**: Brief description of the organised visits that the user will be informed of, after deciding to sign-up.

### [404 PAGE](https://englishgrows.com/history_beyond_myth/404.html) - STRUCTURE
Provides the user with an error page that follows the same line of design as the rest of the site, adding a note of humour to relieve some possible frustration that an error could cause in case something goes wrong. The imagery has been carefully selected, and as a fixed image there is a medieval thinker taken from the *Codex Manesse*, dated around 1250.

## DESIGN ELEMENTS

### AUDIO

- **AVALON PAGE**:
    * **SECTION 1: FRENCH PRONUNCIATION OF ABALONE**

    [***"Ja Nuns Hons Pris"***: Song written by King Richard "The Lionheart" in old French dialect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1BG1UEACHs), provides the user with an entertaining evidence of the predominance of French language whithin the Plantagenet dynasty ruling England during the 12th-13th centuries. It also aims to link to the supposition that *abalone* might be the etymology of *Avalon*, as Guernsey might as well have been commonly nicknamed as the *Isle of Abalones*, being famous for them, as the European reference place where they naturally grew.
    
    2. **SECTION 5: ABALONES, THE SEA TRUFFLES**  
    [***Two Michellin starred chef preparing and cooking abalones***](https://youtu.be/o5VPONMX19Q) evidences that abalones are still very much valued as a luxury product nowadays, considered the *sea truffles* by the French.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED

## LANGUAGES
- To code this project the following languages have been used:
  + HTML
  + CSS
 
## FRAMEWORKS, LIBRARIES AND PROGRAMS USED
- The following have been used:
  + [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - To begin coding the site from scratch. I already had VScode installed previously, due to a previous personal freelance project called englishgrows.com, and I think is a great tool for coding.
  + [Chrome Dev Tools] - To inspect the elements, and be able to spot what element was having an unexpected behaviour, and correct it more efficiently.
  + [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) - To create wireframes
  + [Favicon](https://favicon.io/) - To create the logo, and the icon on the title included in each page of this site
  + [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - For the icons used
  + [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - To select fonts and implement them in the site
  + [Github](https://github.com) - The deploy the site online
  + [Coolors](https://coolors.co) - To insert colors selected previously directly through visual studio code, but used this tool to display the palette beautifully, and insert it in this readme file.
  + [Amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) - To display the site in all types of devices simultaneously.
  + Paint - For resizing imgs and improve the site performance on load
  + [Convertio](https://convertio.co/) - To cenvert image files from PNG or JPG to lighter AVIF, and improve the site performance on load


# DEPLOYMENT

## DEPLOY TO GITHUB PAGES
- I started coding from **Visual Studio Code**, as I had been using it to code my freelancer website as a teacher of English as a second language. My freelance website is [englishgrows.com](https://englishgrows.com) , and I'm the owner of the Google Domain *englishgrows.com*, which is linked to this Github account EdnaTMunill, with nickname [Ethra8](https://github.com/Ethra8) . 

### PRODUCTION

1. Click **Settings** tab:

2. In the left-hand menu, click on the **Pages** link:

### Update after Deployment
- Changed original site name **History_Beyond_Myth** to lower cases, as **history_beyond_myth**:
     + Go to **Settings**:
       
       ![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/history_beyond_myth/assets/80659091/1a9566e0-dda2-47f1-9ed5-7a4bb7278b79)
