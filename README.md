# HISTORY BEYOND MYTH

## Project Overview
- History Beyond Myth is a website that aims at providing the reader with curious coincidences between academically recognised history facts and some of the aspects of a well-known myth, such as the Arthurian cycle. The historical investigation exposed in this site has been going on for many years, and will continue to go on, updating whatever new coincidences are found on this matter.
- This site is useful for anyone who might be interested in history, more precisely from the European early Middle Ages, or also in myths and legends in general.
- The users of this site will be able to sign up in order to receive a monthly newsletter containing any new findings during the ongoing investigation, as well as interesting social and cultural events around Europe, related to myths and/or history from the early Middle Ages. Visits to sites related to the curious coincidences stated in the site will also be organized periodically.
- The users of this site who have already signed up will also be able to share any findings of their own related to the Matter of Britain, by sending the file of their choice through the form provided in the contact page.

Responsive images of the site automatically generated through ui.dev/amiresponsive/. The tool is interactive, and you can can view all pages in all screen sizes simultaneaously [here](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://englishgrows.com/history_beyond_myth/index.html)

**NOTE**: *I customized defect background-color attribute from amiresponsive site from black to whitesmoke, as my website is mostly in dark tones. I did it by changing the elements of the page, more precisely **class="bg-brand-coal"**.*

# UX
You will find in the points stated below a brief study aiming at providing the user with the best possible experience when visiting this site. 
## Target Audience
* Any person interested in unsolved mysteries in general.
* Any person who, regardless of their age, is interested in medieval history and/or myths.

# DESIGN CHOICES

## Colors
I have created the color palette myself, and the [Coolor.co](https://coolors.co/) website has only been used to display all the colors beautifully for the screenshot below. The colors selected are as follows:
- ***Turkey Red*** **#B30502** / **RGB(179,5,2)**:
    + **Use**: All headers' background color.
    + **Rationale**: The selection of this tone is due to two main factors.
        + The 1st point is that it is the background color of the [coat of arms](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blason_maison_Plantagen%C3%AAt.svg) of the [Plantagenet dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Plantagenet), which was the dynasty ruling England (1154-1485), and to which all the main characters of the website belonged.
        + The 2nd factor is that it is also the predominant color found in the illuminated manuscripts dated around the 13th century on which most of our investigation is founded, and more precisely the [roll genealogy of the Kings of England](https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=royal_ms_14_b_vi_f006r) dated c.1300 where our main characters' portraits are depicted. 
- ***Dark Red*** **#8F0303** / **RGB(143,3,3)**:
    + **Use**: Background color for the *footer*, and the *sign-up form*.
    + **Rationale**: A slighly darker tone than the former which ressembles bloodish red, reminding of the tragic and fatal ending of our main character, Arthur I of Brittany, who battled against John Lackland for the succession to the throne of England after King Richard "the Lionheart" died, and supposedly captured and murdered when he was only 16 years old by his opponent, who finally ruled.
- ***White Smoke*** **#F5F5F5** / **RGB(245,245,245)**:
    + **Use**: Fonts that are on an *Eerie Black* background.
    + **Rationale**: To ensure clear contrast and readability for the user. Also, its name *White Smoke* is the signal from the Vatican when a new Pope is selected. The church was all-mighty, and its power had no boundaries back in the Middle ages, so it also brings that to mind.
- ***Eerie Black*** **#1B1B1B** / **RGB(27,27,27)**:
    + **Use**: Backgrounds of content pages as *Arthur* and *Avalon*.
    + **Rationale**: To favour contrast with the colorful captions embeded, taken from medieval illuminated manuscripts on which the investigation is based. The ink used in those early medieval manuscripts, mostly made from insects and ashes, has also inspired this selection.
- ***Onyx*** **#424242** / **RGB(66,66,66)**:
    + **Use**: Fonts that have a background of *White Smoke*, in the *home page description section*, and the *sign-up page sections*.
    + **Rationale**: To gain clear contrast, and ensure users' readability, with a softer tone of dark grey.
- ***Jet*** **#2E2E2E** / **RBG(46,46,46)**:
    + **Use**: The navigation bar background color.
    + **Rationale**: It reminds of the shadows and obscurity that still cover the early Middle Ages' history and myths, still full of shadows to unveil. Also, the contrast with the *Turkey Red* from the headers reminds of the main plot sorrounding this site investigation, full of shadows and blood.
- ***Timberwolf*** **#D6D6D6** / **RGB(214,214,214)**:
    + **Use**: The *headers' 1st letters*, the *vertical or horizontal lines in the headers* that ressemble a spear or sword, and for the background of the *button to the sign-up page* in the navigation bar.
    + **Rationale**: Gives a metal-like appearance. All element have a strong shadow to give it volume. Middle Ages were full of iron: armours, shields, spears, swords, etc. But also cups, and all king of everyday medieval ustensils were made of metal.

## Typography  
- I found in [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) styles that match the Medieval topic of the website.
- The headings decrease in size to ensure full responsiveness of the website.
- Check the selection of Google Fonts [here](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fleur+De+Leah&family=Jim+Nightshade&family=Metamorphous&family=Montserrat:wght@400;500;600;700&family=Reenie+Beanie&family=UnifrakturCook:wght@700&display=swap))
 
### Fonts Used 
1. [UnifrakturMaguntia](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/UnifrakturMaguntia?query=unifrak): Medieval font by excellence, only used lower-case which are very readable, for index header's 1st letters, and for logo. Fall-back font to cursive.
2. [UnifrakturCook](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/UnifrakturCook?query=unifrak): Very similar to the previous, but upper-case are more readable, even if only available in bold. Used only for other pages than index's header, and only for the 1st letters. Fall-back font to cursive.
3. [Metamorphous](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Metamorphous?query=metamor): Medieval font, very readable upper & lower cases. Fall-back font to cursive.    
4. [Jim Nightshade](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jim+Nightshade?query=jim+night): Very readable old script, that fits the topic of the website. Fall-back font to cursive.  
5. [Reenie Beanie](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Reenie+Beanie?query=reeni): Only used in home page header for the word *"beyond"*. Being a modern script font, it brings an interesting contrast with the medieval fonts used in the rest of the header. It symbolyses modern investigation that seeks to go ***beyond*** the myth.  Fall-back font to cursive.  
6. [Fleur De Leah](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fleur+De+Leah?query=fleur): Stylish Flowery design. Exactly the same design used in medieval manuscripts included in website, upon which the investigation lays. Fall-back font to cursive.  
7. [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montse): Modern sans-serif very readable font for main content.   

### Rationale of Use
 - **LOGO**: Use of **UnifrakturMaguntia** for the single *h* from *"history"*. The logo is situated to the left of the navigation bar, and as a favicon in each page meta title:   

  <img width="100" alt="logo" src="https://github.com/Ethra8/History_Beyond_Myth/blob/media/android-chrome-192x192.png">

 - **HEADER (HOME PAGE)**:
      * Use of **UnifrakturMaguntia** (lower case) only for the *1st letters of main words* of main heading of each page.
      * The remaining text in headings use **Metamorphous** (upper case).
      * All headers' extra text (p) use **Jim Nightshade**.
      * **Reenie Beanie** is only used for the word *"beyond"* in the main page header, seeking a clear contrast between history, medieval mythos, and modern contemporary studies which precisely seek to go beyond the myth, trying to bring a modern and fresh approach to it.

- **HEADERS (CONTENT PAGES)**:
      * Use of **UnifrakturCook** (lower case) only for the *1st letters of main words* of main heading of each page.
      * The remaining text in headings use **Metamorphous** (upper case).
      * All headers' extra text (p) use **Jim Nightshade**.

- **NAVIGATION BAR**: Use of **Metamorphous** in capital letters, which gives a very readable medieval style to the site.

 - **SECTION HEADINGS** (h2):
      * Only the 1st letter uses **Fleur De Leah**, which recreates the 1st letters of paragraphs from medieval manuscripts.
      * The remaining text uses **Jim Nightshade**, to ensure readability, but keeping the medieval spirit alive.
 
 - **MAIN CONTENT**
      * **Montserrat** is used for all paragraphs' content to ensure optimal readability of the site.

## Site Structure
The site contains 4 pages navigable pages, and a 404 error page. All pages, including the 404 error page have a navigation bar on the top to allow the user for an easy navigation through the pages. The navigation bar is fixed to enable the user fast navigation through the site, even when scrolling on each page. Each page including the error page also include a footer, which contains icons that link to the site's main social media profiles, as well as enabling the user to seamlessly send an email to the site administrator by clicking on the envelope icon. The pages are as follows:

### [HOME PAGE](https://englishgrows.com/history_beyond_myth/index.html)
Acting as the *landing page*, it contains the header with the title of the site. Underneath it there is a row of depictions taken from medieval manuscripts, all related to the site's investigation and theories on the Arthur mythos. Then, there is the *Site description*, which contains *3 sections*:
1. **About us** - Site dedicated to state curious coincidences between academically recognised historical facts, and the Arthurian cycle, found during years of investigations.
2. **Keeping it Real** - Highlights the fact that the site administrators in no case expose these findings as an ultimate truth behind the myth, but only as they are, just some curious coincidences.
3. **Reasons to Sign Up** - Numbers 4 different reasons a user might find interesting to sign up. This section includes a button-like anchor tag on the bottom that links to the *sign-up page*. The 4 reasons given relate to the target audience, the user profiles and profiles, and are the following:
    1. Receive our monthly newsletter containing updates on any new curious coincidences found around this matter.
    2. Become part of our vibrant community, and attend cultural and social events related to the Early Middle Ages around Europe, such as expositions, lectures, and conferences.
    3. Share any possible new findings of your own with us, and eventually contribute to unveil long-lasting mysteries from the Dark Ages.
    4. Every once in a while, we organize some visits to emblematic sights related to the curious coincidences found between history and myth. Join in!

### [ARTHUR I PAGE](https://englishgrows.com/history_beyond_myth/arthur_I.html) 
States the curious coincidences found between the legendary King Arthur, and the nephew of the childless King Richard "the Lionheart", who had formally named Count Arthur I of Brittany his heir, when this latter was only 3 years old. Count Arthur also had a tragic and fatal ending when he fought against the man who was to become *King John 'Lackland'* after he captured and supposedly murdered Arthur when he was 16 years old, and was supported by most of the continental territories who had been ruled by Richard. These facts are ordered in the following sections, each containing a caption on the bottom of the section, from medieval manuscripts related to the investigation which are all referrenced through tiptools:
1. **Heir to King Richard the Lionheart**
2. **Retained by the King of France**
3. **Death of King Richard I**
4. **Two Kings, One Throne**
![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/history_beyond_myth/assets/80659091/db025a4a-91da-4c96-8c1d-7e96bcbaeb8b)

### [AVALON PAGE](https://englishgrows.com/history_beyond_myth/avalon.html)  
States the curious coincidences found between the legendary Island of Avalon, and the Island of Guernsey, which was highly valued for having the best *European Abalones*, and for its strategic location. Could the *Island of Avalon* be a derivation from *Isle of Abalones*, considering the French pronuntiation of the word?. This page is divided into sections, each containing a picture, a video, or an interactive map on the left, and some related text on the right. The sections are responsive, and change their layout on smaller devices as tablets or phones, where the text goes on the top, and the image, map or video related, on the bottom of each section. The sections are the following:
1. **French Pronunciation of Abalone**: Contains an audio tag with controls of the word [*abalone* in French](https://voix.larousse.fr/francais/322395fra2.mp3). The source of this audio file is the French Larousse dictionary.
2. **England's Kings were French**: Contains a *Youtube* video with a song written by King Richard himself in old French dialect "[Ja nus Hos Pris](https://youtu.be/-1BG1UEACHs)", to provide the user with an entertaining way to acknowledge that in fact, England's kings spoke French on a regular basis, and not English.
3. **The Value of Abalones**: As some users may not be aware of the existence of these marine gastropod moluscs, this section provides referrences on the value of abalones from ancient times, both for their mother-of-pearl large-sized shell, with distinctive shades of color, as for their meat-like taste. Also brings references on how the Isle of Guernsey is home the most appreciated European abalone since ancient times.
4. **Medieval Jewelry**: This section provides the reader with evidence and referrence of medieval jewelry from the Frankrish Kingdom made of mother-of-pearl (most probably abalone). There is also apicture of a [Frankrish gold brooch](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/465810) found dated c.600, part of the *Medieval Art* collection of the **The Met Museum** in New York.
5. **Abalones, the Sea Truffles**: This section aims to provide the reader with more detailed evidence and referrence of what was previously stated in the section "the Value of Abalones". As abalones are still very much valued as a luxury product nowadays, considered the sea truffles by the French, a *Youtube* video has been included showing [Michellin double starred chef preparing and cooking abalones](https://youtu.be/o5VPONMX19Q) in his restaurant.
6. **Strategic Location**: This section has an interactive map from *Google Maps* showing the exact location of the Island of Guernsey, half-way from Brittany and south Wales.
7. **Mists of Guernsey**: This last section finally includes a seascape picture of Guernsey during sunset, clearly showing its mists sorrounding the sharp rocks that go way in the ocean's shallow seabed all around the island. Some imagery of the mythical Island of Avalon depictures the island inmersed into profound mists.

### [SIGN-UP PAGE](https://englishgrows.com/history_beyond_myth/sign_up.html)  
This page contains the following:
- **Sign-up Form**: Placed on the top of the page in any screen size, after the header. On laptops, it is displayed on the right side of the screen, sharind the screen width with the events section. But as this page, as all others, is **responsive**, on smaller devices as tablets or phones, the form stays at the top, not sharing the width with the events section.
- **Events Section**: PLaced on the top-left side of large devices such as laptops, and after the form in smaller devices such as tablets or phones. This section contains two subsections:
    * **Social Events**: Brief description of the events that the user will be informed of, after deciding to sign-up.
    * **Sight Seeing**: Brief description of the organised visits that the user will be informed of, after deciding to sign-up.

### [404 ERROR PAGE](https://englishgrows.com/history_beyond_myth/404.html) 
Provides the user with an error page that follows the same line of design as the rest of the site, adding a note of humour to relieve some possible fustration that an error could cause in case something goes wrong. The imagery has been carefully selected, and as a fixed image there is a medieval thinker taken from the *Codex Manesse*, dated around 1250.
![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/history_beyond_myth/assets/80659091/fac98c2d-966e-4aa8-ae17-90b963d36247)

## Design Elements
### AUDIO
- ***Avalon Page***: Audio tag with controls allows the user to listen to the French Pronunciation of the word *abalone*. The sourceof the audio file is the French [Laurousse Dictionary](https://voix.larousse.fr/francais/322395fra2.mp3)

### VIDEO 
- ***Avalon Page***: there are two *Youtube* videos embeded:
    1. Song written by King Richard "The Lionheart" in old French dialect, which aims to provide the user with an entertaining demonstration of how predominant was French language at that time. It also aims to link to the supposition that *abalone* might be the origin of *avalon*, as Guernsey might as well have been commonly nicknamed as the *Isle of Abalones*, being famous for them, and the European referrence place where they naturally grew. 

### ICONS 
- ***Footer***: Fixed at the bottom of each page, it contains 4 icons. 3 are from social media (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook), and the 4th is an *envelope* icon from which the user can seamlessly send an email to the administrators of the site.   

### INTERACTIVE MAP
***Avalon Page***: Included in the *Strategic Location* section, there is an interactive **Google Maps** map embeded showing the exact location of the Isle of Guernsey.

### FORM
- ***Sign Up Form***: The form is placed in the sing-up page, and includes the following ***inputs***:
    * *2 Inputs type=text required* - The user must include First name, and Last Name to be able to send the form.
    * *Input type=email required* - The user must include an email to be able to send the form.
    * *Input type=radio required* - The user must select 1 of 3 options, on whether he/she likes sight seeing. This field is requested, to help the site administrators decide on the frequency to organize seight seeing visits to emblematic places related to the investigation.
    * *Input type=file optional* - The user can include a file from his/her device, and send it together with the form. This option is meant for the user that has found a new curious coincidence and wants to share it.
    * *Textarea optional* - The user can include a message, if he/she wants to share some thoughts.
