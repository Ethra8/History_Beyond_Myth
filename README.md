## Project Overview
- History Beyond Myth is a website that aims at providing the curious reader with academically recognised history facts that bear curious coincidences with some of the aspects of a well-known myth, such as the Arthurian cycle.
- The historical investigation exposed in this site has been going on for many years, and will continue to go on, updating whatever new coincidences are found on this matter.
- This site is useful for anyone who might be interested in history, and/or in myths and legends in general, and most particularly, the Matter of Britain and the Arthurian cycle.
- The users of this site will be able to sign up in order to receive a monthly newsletter containing any new findings during the ongoing investigation, as well as interesting events sorrounding myths and/or history from the Early Middle Ages around Europe.
- The users of this site who have already signed up will also be able to share any findings of their own related to the Matter of Britain, by sending the file of their choice through the form provided in the contact page.

## DESIGN CHOICES

### Colors
- Red color predominantly found in the illuminated manuscripts dated around the 13th century on which most of our investigation is founded, has inspired the use of red #B30502 for the headers.
- The ink used in those early medieval manuscripts, mostly made from insects and ashes, has inspired the background tone, using #1b1b1b also in order to favour contrast with the colorful captions taken from the illuminated manuscripts.
- The tone whitesmoke has been used for fonts, to ensure clear contrast and readability for the user.
- The headings' 1st letters are in color rgb(216, 214, 214) to give it a metal-like appearance, with contours of
    -webkit-text-stroke: 0.05px rgb(66, 66, 66) to bring volume, inspired by the metal from medieval armours and swords.
 
 ### Typography
 - The logo and the headings' 1st letters of main words in h1 use UnifrakturMaguntia, the rest of all headings' h1 use Metamorphous, and headings' p use Jim Nightshade, all with a fall-back font of cursive. 
 - The word "beyond" in the main page header is the only one to use Reenie Beabie font, seeking a clear contrast between history, myth, and modern contemporary studies which precisely seek to go beyond that, bringing a modern and fresh approach.
 - The navigation bar also uses Metamorphous in capital letters, which gives a very readable mediavel style to the site.
 - The 1st letter of all sections' titles and h2 in general use Fleur De Leah, which recreate the 1st letters of paragraphas from medieval manuscripts. The rest of h2 use Jim Nightshade, to ensure readability, but keeping the medieval spirit alive, all with a cursive fall-back font.
 - Montserrat font has been used for all texts, excluding h1 and h2, as stated above, to ensure optimal readability of the content.
 - The choice of UnifrakturMaguntia, Reenie Beanie, Metamorphous, Jim Nightshade, Fleur De Leah, and Montserrat were selected using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fleur+De+Leah&family=Jim+Nightshade&family=Metamorphous&family=Reenie+Beanie&family=UnifrakturMaguntia&family=Montserrat&display=swap)
 - The headings decrease in size to ensure full responsiveness of the website.

 ### Images
 - The home page has a background image which is a caption of the page [f.361v](https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=royal_ms_16_g_vi_f361v) of the illuminated manuscript dated 1332-1350, kept in the National British Library, called "Les Grandes Chroniques de France" [Royal MS 16 G VI](https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=royal_ms_16_g_vi). The chapter explains how Count Arthur I of Brittany claimed the Throne of England after the death of King Richard the Lionheart, being his rightful heir by birth right. The text calls Arthur "King of Brittany". The depiction of this page of the manuscript shows King Philip II of France arriving to Arthur's castle in Brittany after Richard's death, where Arthur is wearing a crown, and gives homage to Philip in return for his support to Arthur's claim to the throne of England.
 - The home page has a series of small images put in line underneath the heading, all related to the Arthurian cycle. Most reappear in subsequent pages:
