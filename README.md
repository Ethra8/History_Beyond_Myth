## UX

### Target Audience
* 

### Project Goal
* The project is aimed at providing the user with curious coincidences between academically recognised historic facts stated in well-preserved manuscripts from the early middle Ages and academic studies, and a well-known myth such as the Arthurian cycle from the so-called Matter of Britain.
* Members can share any findings of their own, which might contribute to this ever-ongoing historical investigation.
* Members are informed of interesting events related to history from the early middle ages, and/or myths around Europe, and eventually build social networks with shared interests.
* Members can participate in organised visits, scheduled once in a while, to places that bear these curious coincidences between history and myth.

### User Stories
1. As a first-time visitor,
    * I want to learn about curious coincidences found between academically recognised historic facts and the Arthurian legends.
    * I want to get information on how to receive follow ups in the investigation, cultural and social events, and how to become a member to get the monthly newsletter.
    * I want to find the social media links to see the website profile, to look at photos from past events, and maybe follow.
    * I want to know if they organize visits to emblematic sites related to the ongoing investigation, or interesting medieval sites.

2. As a returning visitor,
    * I want to know if any new curious coincidences have been found between academically recognised history fact and the Arthurian legends.
    * I want to sign up as a new member after considering my decision, to receive new updates on possible new curious findings of the ongoing investigation.

## DESIGN CHOICES

### Colors
- Red color predominantly found in the illuminated manuscripts dated around the 13th century on which most of our investigation is founded, has inspired the use of Turkey Red #B30502 for the headers, and a slighly darker tone Dark Red #8f0303 for the footer.
- The ink used in those early medieval manuscripts, mostly made from insects and ashes, has inspired the background tone, using Eerie Black #1b1b1b, also in order to favour contrast with the colorful captions embeded, taken from the illuminated manuscripts.
- The tone White Smoke #F5F5F5 has been used for fonts, to ensure clear contrast and readability for the user.
- The headers' 1st letters are in Silver #CCCCCC to give it a metal-like appearance, with contours of Onyx #424242 which bring volume, inspired by the metal from medieval armours and swords.

  <img width="400" alt="color palette" src="https://github.com/Ethra8/History_Beyond_Myth/blob/media/color_palette.png">

 
 ### Typography
 - The logo, to the left of the navigation bar, and as a favicon in each page meta title, is a single "h" from "history", using UnifrakturMaguntia font.

  <img width="100" alt="logo" src="https://github.com/Ethra8/History_Beyond_Myth/blob/media/android-chrome-192x192.png">

 - The 1st letters of main words in headers use UnifrakturMaguntia, and the remaining h1 text in headers use Metamorphous. All headers' paragraph (p) use Jim Nightshade, all these with a fall-back font of cursive. 
 - The word "beyond" in the main page header is the only one to use Reenie Beanie font, seeking a clear contrast between history, myth, and modern contemporary studies which precisely seek to go beyond that, bringing a modern and fresh approach.

  <img width="900" alt="index header" src="https://github.com/Ethra8/History_Beyond_Myth/blob/media/index_header.png">

 - The navigation bar also uses Metamorphous in capital letters, which gives a very readable medieval style to the site.

  <img width="900" alt="navbar" src="https://github.com/Ethra8/History_Beyond_Myth/blob/media/navbar.png">

 - Only the 1st letter of all sections' titles (h2) use Fleur De Leah, which recreate the 1st letters of paragraphs from medieval manuscripts. The rest of h2 use Jim Nightshade, to ensure readability, but keeping the medieval spirit alive, all with a cursive fall-back font.
 - Montserrat font has been used for all texts, excluding h1 and h2, as stated above, to ensure optimal readability of the content.

  <img width="900" alt="section_h2" src="https://github.com/Ethra8/History_Beyond_Myth/blob/media/section_h2.png">

 - The choice of UnifrakturMaguntia, Reenie Beanie, Metamorphous, Jim Nightshade, Fleur De Leah, and Montserrat were selected using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fleur+De+Leah&family=Jim+Nightshade&family=Metamorphous&family=Reenie+Beanie&family=UnifrakturMaguntia&family=Montserrat&display=swap)
 - The headings decrease in size to ensure full responsiveness of the website.

# Deployment

## Deploy to Github Pages
- I started coding from **Visual Studio Code**, as I had been using it to code my freelancer website as a teacher of English as a second language. My freelance website is [englishgrows.com](https://englishgrows.com) , and I'm the owner of the Google Domain emglishgrows.com, which is linked to my Github account EdnaTMunill, with nickname [Ethra8](https://github.com/Ethra8) . 

### Production
1. Click **Settings** tab:
   
   ![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/History_Beyond_Myth/assets/80659091/b05a629e-a3bc-4a65-ace1-c9a69aad35c3)
   
2. In the left-hand menu, click on the **Pages** link:
   
   ![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/History_Beyond_Myth/assets/80659091/c93123a2-5b17-486c-8645-b8bf6d400a8a)
   
3. In the **Build and Deployment** section, select **Branch**. Click on the dropdown menu and select **main**:
        
   ![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/History_Beyond_Myth/assets/80659091/e4df05ef-4570-49b6-9c1e-965e39dac0ab)

4. Click **Save**:
   
   ![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/History_Beyond_Myth/assets/80659091/afe2aba8-0d95-4b3f-bf2c-df4864363923)
   
5. Wait about 3 minutes, and refresh the page. Then the link to the deployed site will show up like this:
      
   ![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/History_Beyond_Myth/assets/80659091/a85b79f7-7bb4-4e5e-bc1a-b09a1a37161a)

### Update after Deployment
- Changed original site name **History_Beyond_Myth** to lower cases:
     + Go to **Settings**:
       
       ![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/history_beyond_myth/assets/80659091/1a9566e0-dda2-47f1-9ed5-7a4bb7278b79)
     + In the **General** section, update the name and click on **Rename**:
       
       ![image](https://github.com/Ethra8/history_beyond_myth/assets/80659091/12bb14d0-3655-42fb-b3ad-66df19517220)

     + Add **description** and **topics** when saving, which now show on the **About** on the right hand, with the updated name of the 
       site in lower cases:
