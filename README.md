## Author
Edna Torres Munill

## Project Overview
- History Beyond Myth is a website that aims at providing the curious reader with academically recognised history facts that bear curious coincidences with some of the aspects of a well-known myth, such as the Arthurian cycle.
- The historical investigation exposed in this site has been going on for many years, and will continue to go on, updating whatever new coincidences are found on this matter.
- This site is useful for anyone who might be interested in history, and/or in myths and legends in general, and most particularly, the Matter of Britain and the Arthurian cycle.
- The users of this site will be able to sign up in order to receive a monthly newsletter containing any new findings during the ongoing investigation, as well as interesting events sorrounding myths and/or history from the Early Middle Ages around Europe.
- The users of this site who have already signed up will also be able to share any findings of their own related to the Matter of Britain, by sending the file of their choice through the form provided in the contact page.

## UX

### Project Goal
* The project is aimed at providing the user with curious coincidences between academicaqlly recognised historic facts stated in well-preserved manuscripts and academic studies, and a well-known myth such as the Arthurian cycle from the so-called Matter of Britain.
* Members can share any findings of their own, which might contribute to this ever-ongoing historical investigation.
* Members can be aware of any interesting event related to history from the early middle ages, and/or myths around Europe, and eventually build social networks with shared interests.

## DESIGN CHOICES

### Colors
- Red color predominantly found in the illuminated manuscripts dated around the 13th century on which most of our investigation is founded, has inspired the use of Turkey Red #B30502 for the headers, and a slighly darker tone Dark Red #8f0303 for the footer.
- The ink used in those early medieval manuscripts, mostly made from insects and ashes, has inspired the background tone, using Eerie Black #1b1b1b, also in order to favour contrast with the colorful captions embeded, taken from the illuminated manuscripts.
- The tone White Smoke #F5F5F5 has been used for fonts, to ensure clear contrast and readability for the user.
- The headings' 1st letters are in Silver #CCCCCC to give it a metal-like appearance, with contours of Onyx #424242 which bring volume, inspired by the metal from medieval armours and swords.

 ### Typography
 - The logo, to the left of the navigation bar, and as a favicon in each page meta title, is a single "h" from "history", using UnifrakturMaguntia font.

  <img width="100" alt="logo" src="https://github.com/Ethra8/History_Beyond_Myth/blob/media/android-chrome-192x192.png">

 - The 1st letters of main words in headers use UnifrakturMaguntia, and the remaining h1 text in headers use Metamorphous. All headers' paragraph (p) use Jim Nightshade, all these with a fall-back font of cursive. 
 - The word "beyond" in the main page header is the only one to use Reenie Beanie font, seeking a clear contrast between history, myth, and modern contemporary studies which precisely seek to go beyond that, bringing a modern and fresh approach.

  <img width="900" alt="index header" src="https://github.com/Ethra8/History_Beyond_Myth/blob/media/index_header.png">

 - The navigation bar also uses Metamorphous in capital letters, which gives a very readable medieval style to the site.

  <img width="900" alt="navbar" src="https://github.com/Ethra8/History_Beyond_Myth/blob/media/navbar.png">

 - Only the 1st letter of all sections' titles (h2) use Fleur De Leah, which recreate the 1st letters of paragraphs from medieval manuscripts. The rest of h2 use Jim Nightshade, to ensure readability, but keeping the medieval spirit alive, all with a cursive fall-back font.
 - Montserrat font has been used for all texts, excluding h1 and h2, as stated above, to ensure optimal readability of the content.

  <img width="900" alt="section_h2" src="https://github.com/Ethra8/History_Beyond_Myth/blob/media/section_h2.png">

 - The choice of UnifrakturMaguntia, Reenie Beanie, Metamorphous, Jim Nightshade, Fleur De Leah, and Montserrat were selected using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fleur+De+Leah&family=Jim+Nightshade&family=Metamorphous&family=Reenie+Beanie&family=UnifrakturMaguntia&family=Montserrat&display=swap)
 - The headings decrease in size to ensure full responsiveness of the website.
