                <p>Arthur was the postumous son, and only heir, of Count Geoffrey II of Brittany, 4<sup>th</sup>
                    Earl of Richmond, who was son of King Henry II, and King Richard's younger brother. <br>
                    Thus, after his father's death, Arthur was next in line to the Throne of England after Richard, as
                    this latter had no descendance.<br>
                    Arthur was therefore recognized as heir presumptive to the Throne of
                    England by King Richard "the Lionheart" himself in 1190, when he was only 3 years old <a
